# Web of Things (WoT)

A supercharged Internet of Things system that allows real-world objects to be part of the worldwide web application, providing an open and large-scale platform for heterogeneous devices to talk to each other.

## Getting Started

These full tutorials would help you understant the definition of **Web of Things** and how to implement in the real world with several projects. More detailed documentation can be seen in *"[building the **web of things**](https://webofthings.org/book/)"* by Dominique D. Guinard and Vlad M. Trifa. 

### Prerequisites & Installing

No software or hardware knowledge is required.
